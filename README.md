Pycharm project covering my meta technical interview preparation.
In keeping with their preparation guide
(https://www.metacareers.com/careers/swe-structured-escreen-prep),
I am first doing these exercises in coderpad
(https://app.coderpad.io/sandbox)
before migrating to hackerrank to test, copying to pycharm, then pushing to gitlab.

What follows is quoted verbatim from meta's preparation guide:

1. Overview
• Each exercise could take you up to one hour.
• These solutions are written in Java, but you will be able to use your language
of preference in an interview.
• Remember how to analyze how “good” your solution is: how long does it take
for your solution to complete? Watch this video to get familiar with Big O
Notation.

2. Exercises
Note: These exercises assume you have knowledge in coding but not necessarily
knowledge of binary trees, sorting algorithms, or related concepts.
